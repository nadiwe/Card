In the context of my essay, which I am writing at the moment "ecological sustainability in digital design", I am currently dealing with the effects of design processes on the environment. What approaches, what knowledge already exists and how this can be incorporated into small work steps.

That's why I decided to discard my originally created idea and to give myself a little challenge and create an HTML file as small as possible. 

If the website would run over a server, I would have added a gzip compression.
